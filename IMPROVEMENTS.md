# Keras Leaderboard Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the original `keras_leaderboard` repository to make it more user-friendly, maintainable, and compliant with modern Python package standards.

## 1. Enhanced Documentation

- **Comprehensive README**: Added detailed documentation with badges, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines
- **API Documentation**: Added docstrings to all classes and functions following the Google docstring format
- **Usage Examples**: Created clear, concise examples demonstrating how to use the package

## 2. Modern Package Structure

- **Proper Python Package**: Restructured the codebase as a proper Python package with `setup.py` for easy installation
- **Modular Design**: Separated functionality into logical modules:
  - `models/`: Model-specific implementations
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `visualizers/`: Visualization components
  - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## 3. Command-Line Interface

- **Robust CLI**: Added a full-featured command-line interface using argparse
- **Subcommands**: Implemented subcommands for different actions (create, run, display)
- **Customizable Parameters**: Added command-line options for customizing behavior

## 4. Advanced Visualization

- **Interactive Plots**: Added Plotly support for interactive visualizations
- **Layer Visualization**: Created tools to better display model architecture and layer information
- **Comparative Analysis**: Enhanced comparison capabilities between different models

## 5. Testing Framework

- **Unit Tests**: Added comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
- **Test Fixtures**: Implemented fixtures for testing with minimal dependencies
- **CI-Ready**: Made tests suitable for continuous integration environments

## 6. Containerization

- **Docker Support**: Added Dockerfile for containerized execution
- **Environment Isolation**: Ensured consistent environment across different systems

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Versioned Dependencies**: Specified compatible version ranges for all dependencies
- **Modern Packages**: Updated to use current versions of TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

## 8. Code Quality Improvements

- **Type Hints**: Added type annotations for improved IDE support and static analysis
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and reporting
- **Logging**: Added proper logging instead of print statements

## 9. Additional Features

- **Model Export**: Added functionality to export models in different formats
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Enhanced support for hyperparameter experimentation
- **Model Registry**: Improved model tracking and versioning

## 10. License and Legal

- **MIT License**: Added explicit MIT license
- **Citation Information**: Added citation information for academic use
